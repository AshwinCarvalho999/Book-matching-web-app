# Book-matching web app

### Develop a web app with the ability of matching people’s personalities with literature genres and specific books, using a basic form in which you will have to ask 2 questions with different types of inputs. This information must be entered on a basic database where a decision is going to be made and displayed on the screen, based on a difference of vectors. 

> Front-end: create a 1 page user-friendly User Interface with a) a fixed navigation bar, b) two inputs for the user’s answers, c) a frame that displays a visual representation of the results, d) a design that reflects your style. 

> Back-end: create a basic database with the following: a) students are scored on 2 to 3 different criteria, b) books are scored on 2 to 3 different criteria, c) calculate the difference of vectors, d) use the difference of vectors to look for books that match.
